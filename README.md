# Create: Biotech

[English](README.md) · [中文](README.zh-CN.md) · [Player Intro](docs/INTRODUCTION.md) · [玩家介绍](docs/INTRODUCTION.zh-CN.md)

A Minecraft 1.20.1 Forge addon based on [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create), focused on bringing mobs and biological materials into Create's existing kinetic, transport, and processing systems. It includes slime belts, ghast balloons, experience machinery, and the plumbing needed to connect living creatures to basins, contraptions, funnels, and JEI.

This README is mainly for contributors and AI coding agents. If you want a player-facing overview first, read [docs/INTRODUCTION.md](docs/INTRODUCTION.md).

## Working conventions

By default, follow these conventions:

1. **`ref/Create/` and `ref/jei/` are the authoritative local sources for Create and JEI.** Search them with `rg` before touching any integration code. Do **not** decompile jars or fetch upstream from the web unless the user explicitly asks.
2. **Registration goes through Registrate.** Add new blocks/items/fluids/entities/menus in the matching `registry/CB*.java` rather than reinventing the wiring.
3. **Feature code lives in one package under `content/`.** As much as possible, each feature should own its block, block entity, renderer, item, and related handlers. Cross-feature plumbing belongs in `foundation/` or `infrastructure/`.
4. **Behaviour changes to Create or vanilla classes are done through mixins.** Register every new mixin in [create_biotech.mixins.json](src/main/resources/create_biotech.mixins.json); pick the `client` list if it touches client-only code.
5. **Lang keys are bilingual.** Every new key needs both `en_us.json` and `zh_cn.json` entries.

## Key systems at a glance

- **Custom belts** — Slime Belt, Magma Cube Belt, and Power Belt. They follow the usual Create belt behavior and support funnels, tunnels, and the related mixin behavior.
- **Basin entity processing** — entities can enter a Basin through funnels and then be processed as ingredients by the Mechanical Press or Mixer. Recipes live under `content/processing/basin/`.
- **Contraptions** — the Ghast Hot Air Balloon can be assembled into a moving contraption; Buffer Pads provide color-coded movement behavior.
- **Specialty machines** — Spider Assembly Table, Squid Printer (enchanted book copier), Evoker Enchanting Chamber, Creeper Blast Chamber, Bio Packager, Experience pump/buds/tank, Schrödinger's Cat (quantum redstone), Universal Joint (3D rotation transfer), Bone Ratchet, Slime Clutch, Fixed Carrot Fishing Rod, Explosion-Proof Item Vault, Cardboard Box mob capture.
- **Fluids** — Liquid Living Slime and a fluid equivalent of experience.
